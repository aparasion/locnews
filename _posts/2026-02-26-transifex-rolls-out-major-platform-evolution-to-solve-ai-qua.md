XTM International has announced a significant update to its Transifex platform, aimed at enhancing translation quality and managing AI outputs for organizations. Key features include TQI (Translation Quality Index) Tasks, which automate the evaluation of translation quality, allowing teams to focus human review on lower-scoring content, potentially reducing review costs by up to 40%. Additionally, Structured AI Style Guides enable organizations to set clear guidelines for AI translations, ensuring alignment with brand voice and reducing the need for extensive edits.

The update also introduces Add Strings Online, streamlining the process of creating new source strings directly within the platform, which enhances localization efficiency and reduces errors. These advancements reflect a shift in how enterprises approach localization, balancing the scalability of AI with the need for quality control. As companies increasingly rely on non-English markets for revenue, Transifex's enhancements position it as a vital tool for global content management, supporting organizations in maintaining high standards while expanding internationally.
