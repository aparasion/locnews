DeepL, a German startup specializing in AI-driven translation and writing tools, has secured an additional $300 million in funding, bringing its valuation to $2 billion. This investment round, led by Index Ventures, reflects the heightened interest in AI startups, despite DeepL not yet being profitable. The company plans to use the funds for sales, marketing, and R&D to expand its customer base beyond the current 100,000 businesses using its services. CEO Jarek Kutylowski emphasized the need for stronger customer relationships and a shift towards enterprise solutions, as many AI projects struggle to move beyond initial deployment phases. DeepL's recent product, DeepL Write Pro, targets business writing needs. However, it faces significant competition from established tech giants like Google and emerging AI firms.

The funding round included participation from ICONIQ Growth and other previous investors, highlighting DeepL's reputation for delivering valuable AI products.
