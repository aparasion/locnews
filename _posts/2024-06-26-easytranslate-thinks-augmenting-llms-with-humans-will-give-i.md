EasyTranslate, a content translation company founded in 2010, is pivoting to a generative AI-driven model called "HumanAI" to enhance its translation services. The platform utilizes large language models (LLMs) and short-term memory to improve translation accuracy while minimizing human involvement, thereby reducing costs by up to 90%. This approach allows the platform to tailor translations to specific contexts, such as marketing or finance, ensuring that the output sounds natural and relevant. EasyTranslate's services are priced at €0.01 per word, appealing to global businesses with extensive content needs, including clients like Wix and Monday.com. The company has raised €3 million in funding and aims to combine AI efficiency with human oversight to maintain quality and adapt to the evolving nature of language. As the translation market grows, EasyTranslate seeks to differentiate itself from fully AI-driven competitors by emphasizing the value of human-AI collaboration.
