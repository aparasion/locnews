EasyTranslate, a content translation company founded in 2010, is pivoting towards a generative AI-driven model with its new platform, HumanAI. This shift aims to enhance translation efficiency and reduce costs by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to improve accuracy and context in translations, while minimizing human involvement. The platform absorbs content and employs short-term memory to customize translations, ensuring that the output aligns with specific industry terminologies, such as marketing or finance. EasyTranslate claims that its approach can lower translation costs by up to 90%, pricing services at €0.01 per word. The company has raised €3 million in funding and serves notable clients like Wix and Monday.com. Founder Frederik R. Pedersen emphasizes the importance of combining human oversight with AI to maintain quality, acknowledging that while AI can improve, human feedback remains essential for effective language translation. As the translation market evolves, EasyTranslate aims to balance AI capabilities with human expertise to remain competitive against pure AI solutions.
