Timekettle launched its W4 Pro earbuds at CES 2025, featuring real-time two-way translation for phone and video calls in 40 languages. The earbuds automatically translate conversations with a latency of three to five seconds, ensuring seamless cross-lingual communication without user input. While the translated audio is louder than the original, the device also summarizes conversation content using onboard AI. The W4 Pro supports face-to-face translations by allowing users to share an earbud. Powered by the new Babel OS, the earbuds promise quick transitions, customizable lexicons, and translations that convey human emotion and tone. The W4 Pro will be available for $449 starting Sunday, and the Babel OS will also be rolled out to older models. This innovation could significantly enhance global communication, making it easier for users to engage in multilingual conversations.
