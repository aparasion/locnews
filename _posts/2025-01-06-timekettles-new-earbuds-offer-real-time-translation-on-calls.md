Timekettle launched its W4 Pro earbuds at CES 2025, featuring real-time two-way translation for phone and video calls in 40 languages. The earbuds automatically translate conversations with a latency of three to five seconds, ensuring seamless cross-lingual communication without user input. While translated speech is louder than the original audio, the earbuds also utilize onboard AI to summarize conversation content. The W4 Pro can function similarly to previous models, allowing users to share an earbud for face-to-face translations. Powered by the new Babel OS, the earbuds promise quick transitions, customizable lexicons, and emotionally nuanced translations. Babel OS will also be available for older models. The W4 Pro is priced at $449 and will be available for purchase starting Sunday. This innovation highlights Timekettle's commitment to enhancing global communication through advanced technology.
