Alconost has announced the public release of the MQM Tool API, enhancing its free web-based MQM Tool for translation quality evaluation. This API introduces automation capabilities for project orchestration, data import, progress tracking, and structured evaluation results export, while maintaining manual quality assessments by linguists. The MQM Tool is designed for evaluating various translation outputs using the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework.

Key features of the API include programmatic project creation, bulk uploads of translation segments, management of linguist assignments, real-time progress monitoring, and automated result exports. This allows organizations to streamline administrative processes without compromising the quality of human evaluations. The API is particularly beneficial for enterprise localization teams, language service providers, and AI research teams, facilitating scalable quality governance in translation workflows.

Alconost emphasizes that while the MQM Tool API automates operational tasks, the core evaluation remains a human-driven process, reinforcing the importance of expert judgment in translation quality assessment.
