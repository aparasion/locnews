Lengoo, a company specializing in custom machine translation, has secured a $20 million Series B funding round to enhance its translation services for enterprises. Unlike typical AI translation tools used for simple tasks, Lengoo focuses on delivering high-quality translations for technical documents across multiple languages, which is essential for businesses operating in diverse markets. The company aims to automate translation processes while maintaining human oversight to ensure accuracy and consistency. By creating customized language models that incorporate client-specific jargon and feedback, Lengoo claims to improve translation speed and quality significantly compared to competitors like Google and DeepL. The funding will enable Lengoo to expand into North American and additional European markets, further solidifying its position in the competitive translation industry. While machine translation may reduce the need for human translators, it is expected to enhance their productivity rather than replace them entirely, as the demand for professional translation services continues to grow in global markets.
