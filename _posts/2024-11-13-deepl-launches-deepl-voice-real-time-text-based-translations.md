DeepL, a German startup known for its nuanced text translation, has launched DeepL Voice, a real-time audio translation feature. This service allows users to listen to spoken language and receive automatic translations in text form, supporting 13 languages and providing captions for 33 languages. While currently limited to text output, DeepL's CEO, Jarek Kutylowski, hinted at future developments, including potential audio or video outputs.

DeepL Voice targets live conversations and video conferencing, with initial integration in Microsoft Teams. The feature addresses a long-standing customer request since 2017, emphasizing real-time processing, which sets it apart from competitors that often experience delays. The service aims to enhance communication in various sectors, particularly in the service industry.

However, concerns about data privacy arise, as voice data is processed on DeepL's servers, although the company assures compliance with GDPR regulations. As AI voice translation services proliferate, DeepL's strategic focus on building its technology from the ground up may position it competitively in the evolving market.
