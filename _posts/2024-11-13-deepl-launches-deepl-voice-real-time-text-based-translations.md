DeepL, a German startup known for its advanced text translation services, has launched DeepL Voice, a real-time audio translation feature. This new mode allows users to listen to spoken language and receive automatic translations in text format, supporting 13 languages for audio input and 33 languages for captions. While the service is currently limited to text output during live conversations and video calls, CEO Jarek Kutylowski hinted at future developments, including potential audio and video capabilities.

DeepL Voice aims to enhance communication in settings like video conferencing and customer service, addressing a long-standing customer request since the company's inception in 2017. Unlike competitors, DeepL focuses on building its technology from the ground up, utilizing a proprietary language model optimized for translation. However, concerns about data privacy remain, as voice data is processed off-device, although the company assures compliance with data protection regulations. As AI voice translation services proliferate, DeepL's offering positions it competitively in a rapidly evolving market.
