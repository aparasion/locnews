Cisco has acquired EzDubs, a startup specializing in real-time translation services, although the financial details of the deal remain undisclosed. Founded in 2023 by Padmanabhan Krishnamurthy, Amrutavarsh Kinagi, and Kareem Nassar—who previously worked at Cisco—EzDubs raised $4.2 million in seed funding. Cisco plans to integrate EzDubs' technology into its Cisco Collaboration platform, enhancing features like live translation in Webex video calls while preserving the speaker's voice. EzDubs will discontinue its consumer apps by December 15, 2023. This acquisition reflects a growing trend in the translation sector, with recent deals indicating a shift towards enterprise-focused solutions, as the translation services market is valued at around $40 billion. The move raises questions about the sustainability of consumer-focused translation services in a market increasingly dominated by enterprise needs.
