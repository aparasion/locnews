Cisco has acquired EzDubs, a Y Combinator-backed startup specializing in real-time translation services, although the financial details of the deal remain undisclosed. Founded in 2023 by Padmanabhan Krishnamurthy, Amrutavarsh Kinagi, and Kareem Nassar, EzDubs raised $4.2 million in seed funding from notable investors. Cisco plans to integrate EzDubs' technology into its Cisco Collaboration platform, enhancing features like live translation for Webex video calls while preserving the speaker’s voice. The acquisition reflects Cisco’s strategy to leverage AI for improved collaboration tools. EzDubs will discontinue its consumer apps by December 15, 2023, as it shifts focus to enterprise solutions. This move raises questions about the viability of consumer-focused translation services amidst a growing enterprise demand, with the translation services market valued at around $40 billion. Recent trends indicate a consolidation in the translation sector, with other acquisitions highlighting a shift towards enterprise solutions.
