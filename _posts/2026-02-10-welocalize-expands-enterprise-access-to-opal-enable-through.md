Welocalize has announced an expansion of enterprise access to its multilingual AI workflow platform, OPAL Enable, through a collaboration with Blackbird, an integration platform as a service (iPaaS). This partnership allows organizations using Blackbird to seamlessly incorporate OPAL Enable into their existing systems, facilitating the design, deployment, and scaling of multilingual AI workflows without the need for separate implementations. OPAL Enable connects automation and AI with optional human oversight, enabling organizations to optimize their localization processes.

The integration supports various use cases, including global product launches and regulated content workflows, and aims to help enterprises transition from AI experimentation to production deployment. By providing streamlined access to OPAL Enable, Welocalize enhances operational efficiency and flexibility while maintaining control over orchestration and data governance. This move reflects Welocalize's strategy to deliver scalable AI workflow solutions that accelerate return on investment for global enterprises. The OPAL Enable integration is available immediately for enterprise organizations.
