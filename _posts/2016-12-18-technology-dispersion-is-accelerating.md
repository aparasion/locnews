The article discusses the declining trend of "copycat" digital services as the speed of technology dispersion accelerates globally, particularly in high-growth markets like India. The time gap between the launch of a service in the U.S. and its equivalent in other markets has significantly decreased, exemplified by the rapid emergence of Swiggy following DoorDash's funding announcement. Key drivers of this trend include universal human needs, easy access to tech information via the internet, and the widespread adoption of mobile devices.

For businesses, this means they must act quickly to capitalize on opportunities in emerging markets. Startups are advised to focus on large markets, develop repeatable internationalization models, secure substantial funding, partner with knowledgeable investors, and hire talent with a global perspective. While traditional copycat strategies may be fading, local startups can thrive by addressing unique regional challenges and leveraging cultural nuances to differentiate themselves. This shift heralds a new era of original innovation in the global startup ecosystem.
