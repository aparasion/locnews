At CES 2025, Samsung unveiled its Live Translate feature for TVs, which allows real-time translation of live broadcasts by translating closed captions in seven unspecified languages. This feature, initially launched with the Galaxy S24 in early 2024, currently supports 13 languages on mobile devices. Additionally, Samsung introduced AI-based Voice Removal with Audio Subtitles, designed to enhance accessibility for visually impaired users by isolating voices and adjusting subtitle reading speeds.

The announcement highlights Samsung's commitment to integrating advanced technology and accessibility features into its products.
