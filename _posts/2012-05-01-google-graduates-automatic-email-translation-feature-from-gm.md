Google has officially graduated its translation feature from Gmail Labs, allowing users to translate foreign language messages directly within Gmail. Starting soon, an option to "Translate message" will appear at the top of emails written in another language, with users able to disable the feature or set it as a default for specific languages. Additionally, Google has improved Gmail's tab titles for better organization, making it easier for users to identify new messages amidst multiple open tabs.
