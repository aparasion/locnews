XTM International has launched Intelligent Post-Editing, an AI-driven feature designed to automate the review and correction of translated content within its XTM Cloud platform. This innovation aims to alleviate the bottleneck caused by manual post-editing in enterprise localization, which can be time-consuming and costly. Intelligent Post-Editing utilizes context-aware, large language model (LLM) edits to enhance translation quality while maintaining essential human oversight. It automates routine linguistic corrections, enforces consistent terminology, and applies locale-specific checks, all while ensuring transparency and governance through auditable changes.

The introduction of this feature positions XTM as a leader in composable AI for localization, enabling enterprises to improve speed and efficiency without compromising quality. By shifting routine review tasks to AI, localization teams can focus on more nuanced aspects of translation, ultimately accelerating global content delivery. This development is significant for organizations seeking to enhance their international operations and meet the growing demand for swift, high-quality localization.
