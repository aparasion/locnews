Reddit is expanding its user base in India by enhancing its machine translation feature to automatically translate posts and comments into Hindi, with plans to add Bengali soon. This update aims to make more user-generated content accessible in one of India's most widely spoken languages. The machine translation feature was initially tested last May with French and has since been rolled out in over 35 countries, including support for Spanish and Portuguese. Additionally, Reddit recently introduced its AI-powered search feature, Answers, to users in several countries, including India. The platform is prioritizing growth in India, having hired staff for community building, legal, and engineering roles, and is actively seeking more personnel in content and community positions. This strategic move highlights Reddit's commitment to engaging a diverse audience in the Indian market.
