Google is testing a new "Speaking practice" feature in Search aimed at helping users enhance their conversational English skills. Currently available to English learners in select countries—Argentina, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Venezuela—this feature is part of Google’s Search Labs program. It builds on a previous tool launched in October 2023, which allowed users to practice speaking sentences with feedback on grammar and clarity. The new feature introduces interactive conversational exercises powered by AI, where users respond to prompts using specific vocabulary in context. For example, a user might be asked how to get into shape, requiring them to incorporate words like "exercise," "heart," and "tired" in their response. This initiative suggests that Google is positioning itself as a competitor to established language learning apps like Duolingo and Babbel, enhancing its portfolio of educational tools, which have included pronunciation practice features since 2019.
