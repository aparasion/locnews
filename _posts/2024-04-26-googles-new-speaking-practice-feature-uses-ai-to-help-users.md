Google is testing a new "Speaking practice" feature in its Search platform aimed at helping users improve their conversational English skills. Currently available to English learners in select countries—Argentina, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Venezuela—who are part of the Search Labs program, this feature enhances previous language learning tools by incorporating interactive, AI-driven conversational exercises. Users engage in back-and-forth dialogues, responding to prompts that require the use of specific vocabulary in context. For instance, a user might be asked how to get in shape, needing to include words like "exercise," "heart," and "tired" in their response. This initiative suggests Google's ambition to compete with established language learning apps like Duolingo and Babbel, further solidifying its commitment to educational tools, following past efforts such as pronunciation practice features launched in 2019. The implications of this development could reshape the landscape of language learning by leveraging Google's extensive resources and technology.
