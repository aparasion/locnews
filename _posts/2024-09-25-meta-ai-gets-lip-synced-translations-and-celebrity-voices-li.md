At the Meta Connect 2024 conference, Meta unveiled a new voice feature for its AI assistant, Meta AI, allowing it to respond audibly on platforms like Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook. Users can choose from several celebrity voices, including Awkwafina and Dame Judi Dench, as Meta aims to enhance user engagement through high-profile talent, reportedly investing millions for their likenesses. Unlike OpenAI's expressive voice capabilities, Meta AI's feature resembles Google's Gemini Live, which reads answers aloud in a synthetic voice after transcribing speech.

Additionally, Meta AI has been upgraded to analyze images, enabling users to inquire about the content of photos, such as identifying flowers or providing cooking instructions. The company is also piloting a translation tool for Instagram Reels, which dubs creators' speech in different languages while synchronizing lip movements. Currently, this feature is in limited testing with select creators' videos from Latin America translated into English and Spanish in the U.S.
