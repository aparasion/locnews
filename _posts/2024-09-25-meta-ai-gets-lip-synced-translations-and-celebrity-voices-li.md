At the Meta Connect 2024 conference, Meta unveiled a new voice feature for its AI assistant, Meta AI, allowing it to respond audibly across platforms like Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook. Users can select from various voices, including celebrity clones such as Awkwafina and Dame Judi Dench. Unlike OpenAI's expressive voice capabilities, Meta's feature resembles Google’s Gemini Live, which reads answers aloud after transcribing speech.

Meta has invested significantly in celebrity likenesses, aiming to enhance user engagement, though skepticism remains regarding its effectiveness. Additionally, Meta AI has been upgraded to analyze images, enabling users to ask questions about photos, such as identifying flowers or providing cooking instructions. 

Furthermore, Meta is piloting a translation tool for Instagram Reels that automatically translates and lip-syncs creators' speech in different languages, starting with select videos from Latin America. This development highlights Meta's commitment to enhancing user interaction through innovative AI features.
