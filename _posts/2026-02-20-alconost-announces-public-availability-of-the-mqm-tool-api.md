Alconost has announced the public availability of its MQM Tool API, designed to enhance the management of multilingual quality metrics in translation projects.

The implications of this release are significant for companies involved in global communication, as it streamlines the quality assurance process and potentially reduces costs associated with translation errors. By adopting this API, businesses can improve their translation workflows and ensure consistency in messaging across different languages.
