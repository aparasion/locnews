- The study highlights a shift towards valuing automation, platform integration, and measurable outcomes over traditional service relationships, indicating a transformation in buyer preferences driven by digital advancements.
- Key metrics such as unaided and top-of-mind awareness reveal which language service providers dominate buyer consciousness, with 39 companies mentioned as top-of-mind, but only 13 receiving significant recognition.
