Google Translate has enhanced its mobile app with two new features: real-time voice and sign translation, now available on both Android and iOS. The real-time voice translation allows users to converse in different languages, providing instant text-based translations during conversations. Users simply tap the microphone to start speaking, facilitating smoother communication across language barriers. The sign translation feature enables users to point their camera at signs for immediate translation, functioning offline for added convenience.

Currently, these features support translations between English and six languages: French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish, with plans for future expansion. Google reports that 500 million people use Translate monthly, generating over one billion translations daily. This update, powered by the technology from the recently acquired startup World Lens, is expected to significantly enhance user experience and increase the app's popularity among travelers and expatriates.
