Jordan is emerging as a notable tech hub in the Middle East, exemplified by the success of local startup Dakwak, which specializes in website translation and localization. Founded in 2009 by Waheed Barghouthi, Dakwak aims to help small- to medium-sized businesses expand globally by simplifying the translation process. The platform, recently launched, allows users to enter their website URL and select a target language, offering options for both machine and professional translations. Dakwak's services extend beyond text, enabling users to modify images and stylesheets for different languages, and it is developing email translation software for efficient communication.

Since its launch, Dakwak has attracted 30 customers, with English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, French, and Arabic being the most requested languages. The company, backed by investors including 500 Startups and Oasis500, aims to expand its U.S. distribution channels and grow its user base over the next few months, highlighting Jordan's potential in the global startup ecosystem.
