- Global organizations often rely on one-market research to inform product strategies, assuming success in one region translates universally; however, this approach frequently leads to diverging results in international markets.

- Research indicates that a U.S.-centric approach may work in some markets but fail in others, highlighting the necessity for nuanced, comparative cultural insights to understand local consumer expectations and pain points.
- Effective market scaling requires reframing insight generation to prioritize multi-market cultural understanding rather than relying solely on execution improvements in underperforming regions.
- Organizations should reassess their assumptions about market insights when facing performance discrepancies, as cultural complexity is a natural outcome of international growth, not a failure.
