- AI is being integrated into the interpreting field, primarily in low-stakes scenarios, enhancing efficiency but not replacing human interpreters, who remain essential for high-value communications.
- A significant shortage of qualified interpreters is emerging due to declining enrollment in language programs and rising living costs, posing a threat to industry growth unless addressed through investment in education and professional development.
