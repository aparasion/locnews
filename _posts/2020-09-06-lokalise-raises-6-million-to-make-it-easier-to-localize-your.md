Lokalise, a Latvian startup specializing in translation and localization for apps, websites, and games, has raised $6 million in funding led by Mike Chalfen. The company offers a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that streamlines the localization process, which often relies on outdated tools like Excel and Google Sheets. Lokalise allows users to upload language files or integrate with GitHub/GitLab for automatic updates, enabling teams to collaborate efficiently on translations within a web-based interface.

The platform supports both manual and automated translation processes, offering access to Google Translate and a marketplace for professional translators. Currently, Lokalise serves 1,500 clients, including notable companies like Revolut and Notion, generating $4 million in annual recurring revenue. While it may be excessive for some businesses, Lokalise addresses a critical need for companies with frequent updates and global customer bases, potentially accelerating their localization efforts.
