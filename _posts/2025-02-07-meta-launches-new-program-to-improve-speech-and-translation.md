Meta is launching the Language Technology Partner Program in collaboration with UNESCO to enhance AI development through diverse language data collection. The initiative seeks partners to provide over 10 hours of speech recordings, transcriptions, and translated sentences in various languages, particularly focusing on underserved languages. Notably, the government of Nunavut, where Inuktut is spoken, is among the initial collaborators. Meta aims to create open-source AI models for speech recognition and translation, promoting inclusivity in technology.

Additionally, Meta is releasing an open-source machine translation benchmark to evaluate translation models, accessible via the Hugging Face platform. While Meta frames these efforts as philanthropic, they will likely improve the company's AI capabilities, particularly for its Meta AI assistant, which is expanding language support and features like automatic translation for social media content.

Despite these initiatives, Meta has faced criticism for its handling of non-English content moderation, with reports highlighting disparities in addressing misinformation across languages. The company claims to be working on improving its translation and moderation technologies.
