Meta is launching the Language Technology Partner Program in collaboration with UNESCO to enhance AI development by collecting diverse speech recordings and transcriptions. The initiative aims to integrate underserved languages into AI speech recognition and translation models, which will be open-sourced. Initial partners include the government of Nunavut, where residents speak Inuktut languages. Meta emphasizes its commitment to supporting linguistic diversity and addressing complex human needs across cultures.

In addition, Meta is releasing an open-source machine translation benchmark to assess language models, accessible via the Hugging Face platform. While Meta frames these efforts as philanthropic, they also serve to improve the company's AI capabilities, particularly for its assistant, Meta AI, which is expanding its language support and features like automatic translation for content creators.

Despite these initiatives, Meta has faced criticism for its handling of non-English content, particularly in moderating misinformation. The company claims it is working to enhance its translation and moderation technologies to address these issues.
