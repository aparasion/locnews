Google is enhancing its translation service with a new machine learning feature that allows users to translate real-world text—such as on storefronts and menus—without obscuring the original content. Instead of overlaying translations, the new system smartly integrates translated text into images while reconstructing the background using AI, creating a more natural reading experience. This technology employs generative adversarial networks (GANs), similar to the Magic Eraser feature on Google Pixel phones, enabling seamless blending of text and complex images.

This upgrade aligns with Google’s potential plans to develop augmented reality (AR) glasses, as real-time translation could be a significant selling point for such devices. Currently, users translate text and images over a billion times monthly in over 100 languages. However, it remains uncertain whether users will prefer smartphone translations or opt for specialized eyewear, especially considering the mixed success of Google Glass. The new translation feature is expected to be available later this year.
