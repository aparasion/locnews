Apple has launched a new first-party iOS app called Translate, aimed at enhancing translation capabilities for users. This app supports 11 languages and allows for offline use, addressing a gap where Apple previously relied on competitors for translation features.

This move signifies Apple's commitment to improving user experience and expanding its software ecosystem, potentially increasing its competitiveness against rivals in the mobile app market. The introduction of this app may also encourage more users to engage with Apple's ecosystem, as it provides a convenient solution for language barriers without the need for an internet connection.
