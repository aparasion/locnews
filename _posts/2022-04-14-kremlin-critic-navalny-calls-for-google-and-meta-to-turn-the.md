Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny has urged tech giants Google and Meta (Facebook) to use their ad targeting tools to launch a nationwide anti-war campaign in Russia, countering Kremlin propaganda about the war in Ukraine. Navalny argues that the majority of Russians oppose the war but cannot express their views due to severe legal repercussions, including lengthy prison sentences for anti-war sentiments. He suggests that a targeted ad campaign could reach every Russian internet user, helping to reveal the true nature of the conflict, which is often misrepresented by state media.

However, the feasibility of Navalny's proposal is questionable. Both companies have halted ad sales in Russia and have policies that restrict ads related to the Ukraine conflict. Implementing Navalny's idea could provoke further retaliation from the Kremlin, which has already imposed fines and blocked access to several Western platforms. Despite these challenges, Navalny's call highlights the potential for Western technology to disrupt state-controlled narratives in Russia, although it raises complex questions about free speech and the role of foreign companies in domestic politics.
