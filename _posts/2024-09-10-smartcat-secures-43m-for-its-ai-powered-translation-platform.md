However, AI translation services are gaining traction among businesses that prioritize accuracy. Smartcat, founded in 2016, offers automated translation tools and has secured over 1,000 corporate clients, including 20% of the Fortune 500. The company operates a platform that matches content with appropriate third-party AI models and provides options for human review, acknowledging AI's occasional errors.
