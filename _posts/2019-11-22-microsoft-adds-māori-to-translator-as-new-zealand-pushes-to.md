Microsoft, in collaboration with New Zealand's Māori Language Commission, is leveraging machine translation technology to support the preservation and revitalization of the Māori language, te reo Māori. Currently, only about 3% of New Zealand's Māori population speaks the language, which has seen a decline due to cultural assimilation. The partnership has led to the integration of te reo Māori into Microsoft’s Translator service, allowing for automatic translations between Māori and over 60 other languages. This initiative aims to enhance language education and accessibility, making it easier for users to engage with Māori content and documents. The development of this translation tool involved creating a substantial corpus of documents and ensuring translation accuracy, a challenging task given the limited number of speakers. Experts believe that this technology not only helps preserve the language but also fosters cultural heritage, enabling its global sharing and appreciation. The Māori translation program is part of Microsoft’s broader AI for Cultural Heritage initiative, highlighting the potential of technology in combating language extinction.
