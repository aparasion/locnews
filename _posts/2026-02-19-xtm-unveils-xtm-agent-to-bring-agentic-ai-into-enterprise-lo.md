XTM International has launched XTM Agent, a conversational AI tool integrated into XTM Cloud, aimed at enhancing enterprise localization workflows. This innovation is designed to assist project managers and localization teams by streamlining project information and providing clear, actionable guidance. As enterprises increasingly handle numerous small projects simultaneously, XTM Agent addresses challenges such as task prioritization, vendor selection, and quick access to information, thereby reducing administrative burdens.

The AI agent offers instant answers, step-by-step troubleshooting, and recommendations based on project context, helping teams to focus on quality and strategic delivery rather than administrative tasks. XTM's CEO, Lorcan Malone, emphasized that XTM Agent alleviates the pressure on localization teams, allowing them to work more efficiently. This launch builds on XTM's ongoing investment in AI technologies, reinforcing its position as a leader in the global content delivery space. With over 1,300 clients and support for 880 languages, XTM continues to facilitate scalable and effective localization solutions for enterprises.
