Panjaya, a startup specializing in generative AI, has launched BodyTalk, a cutting-edge dubbing tool that translates video content into 29 languages while mimicking the original speaker's voice and adjusting their lip movements. After three years in stealth mode, Panjaya secured $9.5 million in funding, led by notable figures including CEO Guy Piekarz, who previously sold a startup to Apple. The technology aims to enhance video translation for B2B clients, including JFrog and TED, with plans for future API integration and real-time processing capabilities.

Panjaya's approach emphasizes quality and ethical use, steering clear of the negative connotations associated with "deepfake" technology. The company is focused on creating "guardrails" to prevent misuse and plans to implement watermarking tools to identify synthetic media. Despite competition from established players like Vimeo, Panjaya's innovative dubbing solution addresses a significant demand for high-quality, native-language content, which has shown to improve viewer engagement, as evidenced by TED's reported 115% increase in views for dubbed talks.
