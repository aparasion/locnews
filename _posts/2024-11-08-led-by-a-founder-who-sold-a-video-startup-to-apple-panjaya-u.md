Panjaya, a startup specializing in generative AI, has launched BodyTalk, a groundbreaking dubbing tool that translates videos into 29 languages while mimicking the original speaker's voice and synchronizing their lip movements. After three years in stealth mode, the company has secured $9.5 million in funding, led by notable figures including CEO Guy Piekarz, who previously sold a startup to Apple.

BodyTalk aims to enhance B2B video content for clients like JFrog and TED, where dubbed videos have reportedly seen a 115% increase in views and doubled completion rates. The technology, which is currently near real-time, utilizes a combination of third-party AI models and proprietary developments, particularly for lip-syncing. 

Panjaya is positioning itself in the "deep real" category, distancing from the negative connotations of "deepfake," and is focused on preventing misuse of its technology. Despite the prevalence of captions in video consumption, the demand for high-quality dubbed content remains strong, particularly for engaging audiences in their native languages.
