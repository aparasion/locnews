Meta is enhancing its Instagram and Facebook platforms by introducing AI-powered translation support for Hindi and Portuguese, expanding on its existing features for English and Spanish. This initiative aims to facilitate content consumption across linguistic barriers, particularly targeting creators in India and Brazil. Instagram head Adam Mosseri emphasized the potential for creators to reach broader audiences by overcoming language differences. Users can enable automatic translation for Reels, allowing them to enjoy content in their preferred language. Additionally, creators can activate translation options, including automatic dubbing and lip-sync features. Meta is also developing text translation for captions and a new voice-dubbing feature that maintains the original tone of creators. This move positions Meta to compete with YouTube, which has been enhancing its translation capabilities for years. Overall, these updates are designed to foster global engagement and growth for content creators on Meta's platforms.
