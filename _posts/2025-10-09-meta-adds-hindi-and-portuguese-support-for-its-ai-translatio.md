Meta is enhancing its Instagram and Facebook platforms by adding support for Hindi and Portuguese to its AI-powered translation feature, which was initially launched with English and Spanish in August. This move aims to connect creators from major markets like India and Brazil with global audiences, facilitating cross-cultural engagement. Users can enable automatic translation for Reels, allowing them to consume content in their preferred language, while creators can activate translation options before publishing their videos.

Additionally, Meta is developing features to translate text and captions in Reels and plans to introduce a voice-dubbing option that preserves the creator's original tone. These enhancements come as Meta seeks to compete with platforms like YouTube, which has been refining its translation capabilities. By breaking down language barriers, Meta hopes to help creators expand their reach and grow their followings on the platform.
