Palabra AI, a startup focused on AI-driven speech translation, has secured $8.4 million in pre-seed funding led by Alexis Ohanian's venture firm, Seven Seven Six. Founded in 2023 by Artem Kukharenko and Alexander Kabakov, Palabra aims to address the complexities of real-time speech translation, which requires seamless language switching and human-like voice quality. The company claims to have reduced translation latency to 800ms, significantly improving the user experience compared to existing solutions that struggle with speed and realism.

Palabra offers a desktop app compatible with major video conferencing platforms, supporting over 30 languages, and plans to expand its services to content platforms like YouTube and Netflix. The startup also provides APIs for businesses to integrate its translation technology. Despite facing competition from other startups and tech giants like Google, Palabra is developing a new streaming prediction model to further enhance its service. The implications of Palabra's advancements could revolutionize multilingual communication in both personal and professional settings.
