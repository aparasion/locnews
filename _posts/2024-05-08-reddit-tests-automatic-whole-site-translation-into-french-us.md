Reddit is focusing on expanding its international audience, particularly among French speakers, as part of its strategy to boost revenue growth following its transition to a publicly-traded company. CEO Steve Huffman announced plans for real-time automatic translations of site content into French, leveraging advancements in AI. This initiative aims to increase the proportion of non-U.S. users, which currently stands at 50%. Additionally, Reddit is reintroducing its virtual currency, Reddit Gold, and is developing new tools for developers to enhance subreddit functionalities, despite recent tensions over API changes. The company reported a 48% year-over-year revenue increase to $243 million and a 37% rise in unique users to 82.7 million. Huffman emphasized the importance of building infrastructure for revenue generation, including plans to license data to other companies while ensuring user privacy. Overall, these moves signal Reddit's commitment to diversifying its business model and enhancing user engagement on a global scale.
