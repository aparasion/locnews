Google has expanded its interpreter real-time translation mode to mobile devices, now available on both Android and iOS globally. This feature, which previously launched on smart speakers and displays, allows users to initiate translations by simply asking Google Assistant to translate specific languages, such as German or Thai. It provides real-time translated transcripts and audio, along with Smart Replies to facilitate ongoing conversations. The update increases the number of supported languages from 29 to 44, enhancing its utility for travelers. Integrated directly into the Google Assistant app, this feature eliminates the need for separate translation apps, positioning Google’s tools as essential for international travel.
