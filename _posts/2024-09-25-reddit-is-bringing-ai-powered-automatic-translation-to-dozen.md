Reddit is expanding its machine learning-powered translation services to over 35 new locales across Europe, Asia, and Latin America, aiming to make its platform more accessible to non-English speakers. This update follows the introduction of site-wide translation for French speakers five months ago and enhances the existing capability for users to translate individual posts. The new feature allows users to auto-translate both posts and comments within a subreddit, facilitating multilingual conversations without manual translation. Users can select their preferred language settings, and translated posts will be labeled accordingly, with the option to view content in its original language. This initiative is part of Reddit's strategy to grow its user base and ad revenue, especially following its public offering. The translation service is currently available in Brazil and Spain, with plans to support additional languages, including German, Italian, and various Latin American languages, in the near future. This move is expected to enhance Reddit's visibility in search engines for users seeking content in their native languages.
