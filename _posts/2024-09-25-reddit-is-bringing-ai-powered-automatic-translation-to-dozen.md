Reddit is expanding its machine learning-powered translation services to over 35 new locales across Europe, Asia, and Latin America, enhancing accessibility for non-English speakers. This initiative follows the introduction of site-wide translations for French speakers five months ago. Users can now auto-translate posts and comments within communities, allowing seamless conversations in different languages without manual translation. The feature includes a new translate icon for users to view content in their preferred language, with translated posts clearly labeled. This move aims to attract a broader user base and increase ad revenue by making Reddit's content more accessible globally. Currently available in Brazil and Spain, Reddit plans to roll out translations to Germany, Italy, the Philippines, and other Latin American markets soon. This expansion is part of Reddit's strategy to enhance user engagement and visibility in search engines.
