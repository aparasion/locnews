Google has announced significant enhancements to its Google Translate service, adding 24 new languages, including the first indigenous languages of the Americas: Quechua, Guarani, and Aymara. These languages are spoken by over 300 million people globally, with a focus on underserved populations, particularly in Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Notably, the update includes Krio, a dialect of English from Sierra Leone. 

The advancements are made possible by new technologies like Zero-Shot Machine Translation, which allows for the addition of low-resource languages that previously lacked sufficient text resources. This brings the total number of languages supported by Google Translate to 133, although approximately 7,000 languages remain unsupported. The new languages will be available on Google Translate starting today, with full global access expected within a few days. This expansion reflects Google's commitment to inclusivity in language technology and improving communication for diverse populations.
