Google has announced significant enhancements to its Google Translate service, adding 24 new languages, including indigenous languages of the Americas: Quechua, Guarani, and Aymara. These additions cater to over 300 million speakers globally, with languages ranging from Mizo, spoken by 800,000 in India, to Lingala, with 45 million speakers in Central Africa. Notably, Krio, a dialect of English from Sierra Leone, is also included. The selection process focused on underserved languages, particularly from Africa and the Indian subcontinent, as well as indigenous languages often overlooked by technology.

Technological advancements, particularly Zero-Shot Machine Translation, have enabled this expansion, allowing Google to add languages with limited text resources. The total number of languages supported by Google Translate now stands at 133, although approximately 7,000 languages remain unsupported. The new languages will gradually become available to users worldwide over the coming days.
