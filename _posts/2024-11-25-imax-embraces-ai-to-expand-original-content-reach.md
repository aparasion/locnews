IMAX is adapting to the rising global demand for non-English content by partnering with Dubai-based startup Camb.ai to utilize AI for localization of its original films and documentaries. The entertainment industry saw a 5% growth in 2023, reaching $2.8 trillion, with projections estimating a continued expansion to $3.4 trillion by 2028. Notably, Netflix reported a 90% increase in non-English content viewership in the U.K. over three years. Camb.ai's technology, which includes the Boli and Mars models for speech translation and emulation, supports 140 languages and is designed to capture nuances in translation. IMAX plans to implement these AI translations in stages, starting with high-resource languages, aiming to reduce translation costs and enhance content accessibility. This move reflects a broader trend in the media landscape, emphasizing the importance of localized content to attract diverse audiences. Camb.ai, which recently raised $4 million in seed funding, is also preparing for a larger pre-Series A round to expand its operations.
