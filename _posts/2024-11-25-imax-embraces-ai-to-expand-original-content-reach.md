IMAX is adapting to the rising global demand for non-English content by partnering with Dubai-based startup Camb.ai to utilize AI for localization of its original films and documentaries. The entertainment industry, valued at $2.8 trillion in 2023, is projected to grow to $3.4 trillion by 2028, with non-English content gaining traction even in traditionally English-speaking markets. Camb.ai's AI technology, which includes its Boli and Mars models for speech translation and emulation, supports 140 languages and aims to enhance viewer engagement through efficient dubbing. IMAX plans to implement these AI translations in phases, starting with high-resource languages, potentially reducing translation costs. This partnership reflects a broader trend in the media landscape, emphasizing the importance of localized content to capture diverse audiences. Camb.ai, which recently raised $4 million in seed funding, is also preparing for a larger pre-Series A round to expand its operations.
