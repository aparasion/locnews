Interactio, a remote interpretation platform catering to high-profile clients like the UN and BMW, has secured $30 million in Series A funding, led by Eight Roads Ventures and Storm Ventures. The startup experienced a 12-fold increase in usage during the pandemic, highlighting the growing demand for multilingual online meetings. Interactio connects clients with certified interpreters for real-time interpretation and offers integration with popular video conferencing tools like Zoom and Webex. 

With over 1,000 freelance interpreters and a commitment to quality, the company aims to expand its client base beyond institutions to include more corporate clients. The funding will enhance technology and user experience, as well as grow its interpreter pool to meet rising demand.

The company's focus on hybrid solutions positions it well in a market increasingly reliant on remote work and virtual meetings.
