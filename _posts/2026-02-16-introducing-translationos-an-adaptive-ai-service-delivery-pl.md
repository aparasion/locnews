Translated has launched TranslationOS, an adaptive AI service delivery platform designed to enhance localization workflows for enterprises. This platform shifts the focus from traditional translation memory (TM)-centric methods to a context-centric approach, enabling organizations to manage the complexities of translation more effectively. By integrating AI with human translators, TranslationOS automates processes like translator availability and data collection, providing teams with real-time visibility into progress, quality, and costs.

Marco Trombetti, CEO of Translated, emphasizes that the future of localization lies in improved systems rather than just better AI models. TranslationOS allows for seamless integration into existing workflows via API and various content management systems, ultimately reducing operational overhead and transforming localization from a bottleneck into a growth driver. This innovation aims to enhance brand consistency across markets and facilitate expansion into new languages while maintaining transparency and control in localization efforts. Translated, founded in 1999, continues to be a leader in AI-powered translation services, having developed advanced tools like Lara, a high-performing translation AI.
